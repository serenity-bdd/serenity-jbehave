#NOTE:JBehave is no longer currently supported in Serenity BDD - we advise migrating to Cucumber instead#

## Serenity JBehave Integration

Serenity (previously known as 'Thucydides') is a library designed to make writing automated acceptance tests easier, 
and more fun. 

## What does it do?

This module lets you write your BDD acceptance tests using JBehave, and generate fabulous living documentation reports
based on the outcomes of these tests.
